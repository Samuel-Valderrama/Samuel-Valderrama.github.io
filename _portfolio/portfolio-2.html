<p style='text-align: justify;'>

We were developing during 5 weeks in the mechatronic design course where we designed a resin 3D printer. Being one of the projects with more detailed engineering in which it participates.
Mechanism movement analysis, FEA, DFM and DFA simulation are included. With the support and supervision of our mentors Erick Ramírez-Cedillo and Hiram Uribe Hdz.

More than 180 parts, drawing and assembly in SOLIDWORKS software by Dassault Systèmes
