    The Automobile Guide Vehicle was designed to transport products, withdraw them and place 
    them autonomously, intended to be used in warehouses.
    <br> <br>
    For the development and simulation of this AGV, I had the opportunity to be the project leader
    where I was able to coordinate the mechanical design and program the embedded systems to perform 
    various robot functionalities such as movements, obstacle detection, communication with a mobile app,
    implementation of protocols UART, I2C, among others.
    <br> <br>
    For the AGV functionality, an ARM-type microcontroller was programmed in C language, 
    an open-loop control was implemented for the movement in MATLAB, 
    and we used SolidWorks to simulate the mechanical design.
