    Beach cleaning robot capable of moving on sandy terrain developed based on the TMR tournament rules.
    <br> <br>
    In this project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the programming for the detection of obstacles, the surrounding water to prevent the immobilization of the robot, also in the detection of garbage employing computerized vision.
    <br> <br>
    For robot mobility, a differential control closed-loop was programmed based on the distance and position of the garbage located in order to collect it.
