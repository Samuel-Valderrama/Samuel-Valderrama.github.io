<p style='text-align: justify;'>


I am a person who considers himself passionate about technological design. As a <b>mechatronics engineering student </b>, I would like to collaborate in cutting-edge technology development with the aim be able to contribute to the improvement of processes and provide new ideas to benefit technological users and society. Currently, I am coursing my eighth semester at the <b> <i>Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey </i> </b>, and it has been possible due to my scholarship "Lideres del ma√±ana"; which covers 100% of my scholar tuition. 
<br><br>

During my academic training, I have had the opportunity to participate in diverse activities and projects such as be a member of a representative team (Robotec) in a robotics competition for TMR (Torneo Mexicano de Robotica), development and design project of automatic guidances vehicles with <i>Fluxing Engineering</i> as a training partner, participate in social activities as a member of a student group (SALID) in the state of Veracruz, and among others.

<br><br>
My professional interest is to put into practice my knowledge for technologicaldevelopment in industrial automation,especially in robotics, semiconductors technology, programming, structure & data analysis.
