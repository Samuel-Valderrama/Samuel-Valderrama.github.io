I believe that having a healthy life is relevant to doing hobby activities since mental and physical health is part of our stability as individuals. Throughout my life, I have been able to carry out some sports and cultural activities such as those mentioned below.

Mix Martial Arts (MMA)
======
At the age of 17, I got to know the world of mixed martial arts that has given me benefits in my life, such as being a peaceful person and learning to concentrate on carrying out activities in a methodological way.

In 2017 I had the opportunity to participate in a local martial arts tournament where I reached the final.

Soccer
======
Since I was a child, I have played soccer with my friends and on local teams, which has helped me to value teamwork since I am not very good at this sport, but together I have learned to achieve small goals.

Hiking in mountains
======
In the state of Veracruz, where I am from, I like to go hiking as there are many mountains around it, and it helps to clear my mind and enjoy the landscapes.

Dancing
======
Without a doubt, dancing is one of the things that most inspire me, and that allows me to learn a lot about myself and continuously learn about my motor memory.
