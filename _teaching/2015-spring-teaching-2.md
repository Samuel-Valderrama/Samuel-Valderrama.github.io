SALID was the society of students of leaders of tomorrow from Veracruz whose purpose was to carry out social activities for the social benefit of the community in various social areas.

I was fortunate to be a member of the founding generation of this academic group in which we carry out the following humanitarian activities for the community.

In this project, I was the opportunity to support some students to improve their academic skills in mathematics and literature areas.

Also, we had the chance to do some activities as a literary group where we could share some books for them.

Entrepreneurship courses for public benefit

In this project, I had the good fortune of being an organizing member of entrepreneurship courses that were taught by professional experts in the field. Who provides the society with entrepreneurship tools to improve their quality of life.
